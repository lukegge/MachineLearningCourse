        "The **goal** of this assignment is to implement a $k$-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier that performs classification on the accompanied dataset. The dataset is 5-dimensional and consists of numerical features, only. Each datapoint belongs to either of three classes. Train a kNN classifier in such a way as to maximize its performance and to generalize well.\n",

        "* to implement the ML pipeline using *scikit-learn* as discussed in the lecture and the lab course, following best practices;\n",
        "* to properly perform hyperparameter tuning from which clearly follows which value of $k$ has been chosen and why;\n",
        "* to compare the performance of the best trained model on the training, validation and test datasets, preventing both overfitting and underfitting.\n",

        "This assignment will be **graded** based on:\n",
        "* whether these objectives have been achieved;\n",
        "* whether the solution follows best practices;\n",
        "* how well the approach is documented (e.g., using text cells, plots, etc.);\n",

        "* the performance of the trained model.\n",
